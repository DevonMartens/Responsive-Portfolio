Unit to 2 Homework:
 
This portion was the second part of Unit 2's Homework. The purpose of this assigment was to get us to write media queries to have a responsive portfolio. The inital HTML and CSS code for the portfolio was written in Unit 1. The media queries written were done in Unit 2.


A media query is a technique for delivering a tailored style sheet (responsive web design) to any size screen or device for example: desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

An example of a media query is written below:

@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}

It means that any screen below 600px in width will have a lightblue screen.
