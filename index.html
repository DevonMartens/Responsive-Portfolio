               <p>Hello, my name is Devon Martens. I am a student at Georgia Institute of Technology's coding bootcamp.</p> 
               <p> I have some experience working in Technology and with code. I worked as a Business Anaylyst at the Home Depot's corporate office. I used mySQL to research major appliances canceled in transit. I ran reports on these items to help figure out how to speed up customer refunds. One report I ran had as many as 2,000 major appliances locations listed this is about 2.5 million dollars worth of product.</p> 
               <p>I am currently building the website for a new resteraunt in Decatur, Georgia called the Companion. I am the only engineer working on this project and am very exicted to see the results.</p>
               <p>I want to work in environment that allows me to use all of the skills I have devloped in coding bootcamp and in my career thus far. I am exicted to continue build and enhance technology for my future employer.</p>
               <p1> Please review my portfolio and github page to see some examples of code I have written. I look forward to discussing oppertunities and learning more about the industry.</p>
