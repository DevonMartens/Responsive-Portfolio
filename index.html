            <p6>Here's a bit about me:</p6>
            <br>
               <p7>I will have a Coding Boot Camp Certification from the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p7>
               <br> 
               <p8>My expected graduation is February 2020.</p8> 
               <br>
                <p9>I hope to have completed a portfolio with work showing how much I have learned by then.</p9> 
                <br>
                <p10>I love creating innovative web creations!</p10>  
                <br>
                <p11>I have worked as a Case Worker and Mental Health in the past.</p11>
                <br>
                <p12>I graduated in 2016 with B.S. in Psychology and a B.A. in Social Work in 2018.</p12>
                <br>
                <p13>I have a technical background and have been contracted in the past as a Business Analyst.</p13>
                <br>
                <p14>I wanted to learn more and be more valuable in the Tech Industry.</p14>
        <br>
        <p15>I want to work in Technology because you can help others and create new things</p15>
                <br>
                <p16>Plus I noticed Developers have more fun! I am exicted to become a develeoper.</p16>
