               <p>Hello my name is Devon Martens.</p>

            <p>Here's a bit about me:</p>
            
               <p>I will have a Coding Boot Camp Certification from the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
                
               <p>My expected graduation is February 202
                <p>I hope to have completed a portfolio with work showing how much I have learned by then.</p> 
                <b>
                <p>I love creating innovative web creations!</p>  
              
                <p>I have worked as a Case Worker and Mental Health in the past.</p>
                
                <p>I graduated in 2016 with B.S. in Psychology and a B.A. in Social Work in 2018.</p>
                
                <p>I have a technical background and have been contracted in the past as a Business Analyst.</p13>
                
                <p>I wanted to learn more and be more valuable in the Tech Industry.</p>
        
        <p>I want to work in Technology because you can help others and create new things</p>
